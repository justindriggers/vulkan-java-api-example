This repository provides an example of using the [Vulkan Java API](https://github.com/justindriggers/vulkan-java-api) to
implement the triangle example from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle

### Getting Started

Simply run:
```
$ ./gradlew run
```

As long as your system supports Vulkan, you should see the triangle demo appear:
